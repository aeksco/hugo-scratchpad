###Description
Observatory is a web site that powers RCOS. It is a tool for helping people outside of RCOS and RPI to know about what we do as well as providing faculty administrators with powerful tools to help grade and keep up to date on projects. 

###Alternatives

As RCOS is a very unique organization there are not many tools out there that satisfy the use case that we need. Tools like Github allow teams to manage directories of projects but there are no tools for blogging or tracking projects outside of ones hosted under your account.
