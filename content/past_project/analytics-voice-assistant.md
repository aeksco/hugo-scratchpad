AVA is a voice assistant specifically designed for performing business data analytics. It's main functionality is the ability to interpret user speech/text input, map the input to an intent, communicate the request to a web service that performs a corresponding database query, and then return the desired information to the chatbot as a response. The chatbot will have machine learning capabilities to train itself on new, unrecognized inputs, as well as universal database integration.
