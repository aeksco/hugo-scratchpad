Slick is an operating system kernel, as well as the name of the group of projects comprising of the kernel, bootloader, and drivers. It is designed to be an extensible microkernel that limits the amount of abstraction required to write and run an application. The premise behind this idea is that software can still be written to take advantage of exsisting abstractions and frameworks, while still having the flexibility to access lower-level components to increase performance without sacrificing stability and safety.
