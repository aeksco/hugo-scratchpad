Despite a variety of financial scoring models present, FICO remains King of the scoring models even with its’ limitations. These limitations found within the FICO system continue to expand wider as individuals seek to use cryptocurrency solutions which at this time FICO does not support. The goal of BSCORE is to continue expanding on an alternative scoring model that focuses on cryptocurrency solutions. The model should provide a fair and comprehensive view of individual’s financial history and future.
