RPI’s Shuttle Tracker shows the locations of the campus shuttles, along with their routes and stops. Shuttle Tracker uses Go and MongoDB on the backend, HTML/JavaScript/CSS for the web interface. This semester, we will be focusing on adding an ETA system to provide estimations for shuttle arrival times. This would form the basis of a notification system to allow students to set alerts before a shuttle arrives at a stop. This project is supported by the RPI Student Senate’s [Web Technologies Group](https://webtech.union.rpi.edu).
