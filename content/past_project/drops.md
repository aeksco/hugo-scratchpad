Drops is a flexible event planning mobile and web app that simplifies the process to the 5 Wâ€™s: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How? A Drop created by a user can be as detailed or open-ended as they choose by allowing guests to suggest activities, locations, and times they are available. 
Drops provides a sleeker approach to gathering your friends and taking your group chat plans to the real world because Facebook events are too inflexible and cumbersome to set up. Facebook Events Yes/ Maybe/ No does not give reliable data on when you could reschedule to allow more people to join you. Drops will utilize a built in when-is-good system to help Drop creators democratically decide when is best. Other flexible meeting and event planning solutions like Fasterplan are geared towards the business world and lack integration with major social media platforms.
