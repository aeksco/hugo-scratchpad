Table Tome is a Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition toolbox. The goal of Table Tome is to provide users with a searchable and filterable table of spells so that they can quickly access game rules without the hassle of searching through the alphabetical handbook. The future of Table Tome can include anything from mobile applications to an extensive list of additional features, from custom spells to character sheets.
