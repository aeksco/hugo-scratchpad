It is created as a part of the [Rensselaer Center for Open Source](https://rcos.io/projects/lmsgrabber/lmsgrabber/profile) and [Software Design and Documentation](https://sites.google.com/site/rpisdd/) courses.


Currently being worked on by [Jacob Lane](https://github.com/Jacob-Lane), [Colin Atkinson](https://github.com/colatkinson), [Chris Veccio](https://github.com/ChrisVech), [Mark Robinson](https://github.com/robinm8), and [Adeet Phanse](https://github.com/phansa).


See also the [custom Conductor fork](https://rcos.io/projects/lmsgrabber/conductor/profile) being used and maintained as a part of this project.
