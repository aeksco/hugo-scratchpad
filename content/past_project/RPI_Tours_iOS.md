Currently, all prospective students take identical tours of RPIâ€™s campus. The tour is given by a student tour guide around both academic campus and freshman hill. In some cases, recruited athletes receive special tours of the East Campus Athletic Village, which are conducted either by a team member or a coach. With a campus as large and as multi-disciplined as Rensselaer, seeing everything that the school has to offer in one, generalized tour is not feasible.

This is where RPI Tours comes in. By using GPS Location and details provided by the Department of Admissions, the RPI Tours application will provide a series of self-guided tours to allow prospective students, parents, and alumni to see different parts of the campus that they, otherwise, would not be able to see in a tour. New tours can be added and tours can be changed over the air, as the Office of Admissions will have a web-based dashboard that can edit/create new tours.
