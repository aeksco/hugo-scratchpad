We will design and develop a website to provide statistical analysis on various sports and use the data to produce various metrics used to determine potential future performance of both teams and individual players in the sports.  This website will provide a wider range of coverage than the sport specific websites that already exist and also provide additional metrics that do not exist that we will develop with the intention of providing additional insight on the sports we cover.  
	We will design the site and write scripts to periodically gather data to provide accurate and up to date information year round as opposed to the seasonal updates of other traditional websites of this nature.

To date we have the NFL page up and running pulling data from our mongo database.  We have parsed .csv files for previous seasons and have the data for players stored in JSON documents that we will use to populate our database.  We are in the process of adding a second sport to the site as well.
