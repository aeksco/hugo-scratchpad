This is an HTML5 remake of the two first generations of Pokemon using TypeScript/JavaScript. FullScreenPokemon is built on top of GameStartr, a TypeScript game engine that also powers FullScreenMario (FSM), a much more complete project. All the modules in GameStartr, along with the style guide, are open source TypeScript projects on GitHub, in the FullScreenShenanigans organization.
