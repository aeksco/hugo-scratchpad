Astronomy is a rewarding hobby that fewer and fewer people get to enjoy. It’s very difficult to find cool objects in the night sky without expensive Goto telescopes or equatorial mounts, both of which also require complicated calibration. Binoculars are very cheap, are portable, and are very easy to use. However, they require a lot of domain knowledge to find objects.

What if we had a voice based interface for guiding novice binocular users from very bright easy-to-find objects to faint but interesting objects. We can make a path from the bright object to the faint object by using a few stars that would make up recognizable shapes, as well as transition motions like (up,down,right,left). 

Essentially, this app would automate an already existing astronomy technique known as “star-hopping”.
