The stethoscope is an acoustic medical device for auscultation, or listening to the internal sounds of an animal or human body. It typically has a small disc-shaped resonator that is placed against the chest , and two tubes connected to earpieces, It is often used to listen to lung and heart sounds. It is also used to listen to intestines and blood flow in arteries and veins. And with the development of technology, people start to design some digital stethoscope connected to computer to get accurate data. In this project, we are going to use Littman 3200 stethoscope.
 
The purpose of this project is to build customized interface and get and visualize the sound data so that we are able to perform some specific sound analysis.
