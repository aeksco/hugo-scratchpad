Nowcast Beach Status predicts water quality conditions at select beach swimming areas. Nowcast estimates conditions similar to a weather forecast, by merging environment and climate data with variables measured at a beach by 8 AM each morning and entering them into a computer program. The program provides a probability from 1 to 100 as to whether or not the beach has exceeded the bathing-water standard of 235 colony forming units of E. coli.

Note: If you go to the link above be aware that a lot of beaches are closed or will be closing soon since the season is ending so their marker on the map will be gray. ALSO, a dummy database for testing will soon be added along with the php files where you enter the database credentials that were removed with the .gitignore
