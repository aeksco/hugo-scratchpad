GForce is an iPhone application that uses the built-in platform sensors to collect data about driver behavior surrounding “high acceleration/g-force events.” Being an iOS app, the project is developed in Swift 3 for iOS 8-10. The project is nearly complete (though has some unsolved issues) and is entering testing and verification soon.
