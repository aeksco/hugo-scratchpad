The tool would use information from the API to determine what margins exist, if the item is trading at historic highs or lows, at what volume items are trading at and divided amongst how many orders. Account for players skill levels and standing to determine what fees a transaction will accrue and how this affects profitability. Eventually I would like to implement systems to identify items that are having their value artificially inflated or deflated and perhaps a companion app that would track market orders and give alerts of rapid spikes or dips in prices for items the user is interested in.
