RPI Petitions is a place for sparking change at Rensselaer. Students can share ideas with the RPI community, gain Student Senate support, and influence decision making throughout student government and the Rensselaer community.

The RPI community votes on the petitions, and once a minimum threshold is reached, a response is issued by an appropriate representative or leader knowledgeable of the issue.
