The Linux kernel is one of the most widely used, freely available software projects known to modern man. It’s been maintained with patches for the past 20 years, which either fit the original design or are pushed in to maintain functionality, which makes it quite a diverse codebase. Our effort is to apply patches and modify the source as we see fit to get “full functionality” on Apple’s latest hardware. This includes writing a keyboard driver, a trackpad driver, and some other hardware hooks, for letting the device sleep, audio, etc. Our main concern is writing code that is up to Linus Torvald’s standards.
