Inspired by the rise in cryptocurrencies, our goal is to provide a simple open source platform, that uses existing exchanges like Poloniex, for people to run their own trading algorithms and strategies. The multiple trading platforms that already exist either deal with only hypothetical money (Quantopian) or are behind a paywall (CryptoTrader). We want to offer a lightweight solution where traders can get their own strategies and other usersâ€™ strategies up and running as easily as possible.
