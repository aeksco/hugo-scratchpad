An android application focused around connecting college students with easy-to-make recipes and suitable restaurants around the area based on their dietary needs. The main goal of this app is to make the lives of hungry college students, who are living off-campus or have special dietary needs that the dining halls fail to meet, easier.

Check out all the features we want to implement for this app at our github page.
