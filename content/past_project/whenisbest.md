This project focuses on developing a “Group Calendar” for people. It will involve automated scheduling to determine a time or day where most, if not all, of your friends/family/group members will be free and available. Determination of the “best” time will use a ranking feature that prioritizes for example the number of people able to attend, the importance of the event, etc. Users input their main schedules, which will not be visible to other users, into the application and events will be added or deleted to their schedules accordingly, based on what they sign up for. Whenisbest introduces a “group” feature. A user can be a part of multiple different groups and use the same schedule for all of them.
