Inspiration

A housefly is a rather simple organism, yet it is able to independently make decisions to achieve its goals, such as navigating to a food-source and avoiding obstacles. Inspecting closer, a housefly is able to make these decisions instantaneously, such as in the case of being swatted at by a human. If one thinks about the descent of a lander onto the Martian surface, the nature of the situation is quite the same. Because communication with Earth is prolonged, the lander must make decisions on its own in order to safely land on the surface. If a common housefly can independently make decisions in real-time, in uncertain dynamic environments, than surely a spacecraft should be able to do the same in an environment where the objective is clearly outlined.

Goal

This library aims to implement various machine learning and computational intelligence techniques in a variety of common astrodynamics applications.
