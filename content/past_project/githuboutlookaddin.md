Outlook has an extensibility platform that allows developers to create "Addins" for email. Using Javascript APIs developers can get information from emails and edit emails in compose forms to help outlook users be more productive. Using GitHub's Issues API, we want to make an Outlook addin that allows users to open an issue on a GitHub repository from an email message.
