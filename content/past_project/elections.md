The Elections website provides a way for students to see who is running to represent them during student government elections. It provides a list of candidates, candidate profile pages, candidate nomination validation, and information about election-related events. Elections uses Node and MySQL/MariaDB on the backend, HTML/JavaScript (Angular)/CSS for the web interface. This semester, we will be focusing on overhauling the UI to make the site friendlier and easier to use. This project is supported by the RPI Student Senateâ€™s [Web Technologies Group](https://webtech.union.rpi.edu).
