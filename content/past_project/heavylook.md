HeavyLook, when completed, will alter the size column of Windows Explorer in details view, to display the sizes of files of both files AND folders. The secondary goal is to include that information in the details pane as well.

Current goal is to create a program that indexes the size of every selected folder when activated; stores it, then displays it. Giving control to the user when and what is indexed, should take a load off of the system.
