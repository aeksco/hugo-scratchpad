Certain sites automatically lock your account if you do not log in every so often (EMS Charts -- 1 month). It can be a hassle to get a account unlocked after it auto locks. This project would also have the potential for features such as fetching important data, and emailing/alerting user. This project would keep in mind that  users may want to use the same concept for other web pages.
