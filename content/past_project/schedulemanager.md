Modern-day scheduling and planning applications can keep track of appointments that you set and can give you reminders, but they have a few flaws. One of the most notable is that if you set aside time for something like studying and then “forget” to do it, or if you forget to make a schedule altogether, the app can’t enforce it, making it difficult to use these applications to form good habits. Schedule Manager will be a scheduling app for Android written in Java that incentivizes active scheduling and following through on scheduled events by giving the user a score, sort of like a credit score but for time management.
